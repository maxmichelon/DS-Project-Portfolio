# DS-Project-Portfolio

Welcome to my Data Science Project Portfolio on Github! This repository contains a collection of data science projects completed during my time at the University of Oregon and personal projects. These projects showcase a variety of skills in data cleaning, SQL, Python, machine learning, and data visualization.
